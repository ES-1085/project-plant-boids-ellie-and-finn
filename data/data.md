- `location`: qualitative character variable; the name of the island the
  data observation was collected on
- `collected.by`: qualitative character variable; who was taking the
  observations
- `data`: discrete numerical; date data was recorded
- `gps`: qualitative character variable; plot code as denoted in
  ArcGIS/GPS unit
- `cover`: discrete ordinal; % cover classes (entered as highest number
  in range)
- `height`: discrete ordinal; height classes up to \>1.5m, entered as
  their class code (height range information in metadata, number denotes
  which class. Height increases as code increases.)
- `common`: qualitative character variable; common name for species
  observed.
- `spp_code`: qualitative character variable; 6-letter species code
- `spp`: qualitative character variable; scientific name for species
  observed
- `notes`: qualitative character variable; notes from plot

Each row is a species observation. - â€¦
